# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a Computer Science and Engineering student at Politecnico di Milano with focus on artificial intelligence and machine learning.

**Currently working on my Master Thesis about agricultural robotics and deep learning**. The pipeline of the project includes sensor installations on mobile robotic platform, in-field data acquisition, instance segmentation experiments on public/private datasets, multiple object tracking on detected objects and fruit volume estimation.
